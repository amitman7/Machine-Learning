# Machine Learning regression Problem 


Given a **dataset**  (ass3.pickle), we divide it into three parts: ** train, dev and test.**  
The firsttwo parts are used for experiments, and the third part will be used for evaluation (beware of data leaks!).  
**Given these, your goal is to produce the most accurate regressor.**  

You need to justify by experiments each of the steps that lead to your model, specifically focusing on:    
    • Show the preliminary data analysis that you did.
    • Show all the different models that you tried, and explain how you chose the best one.
    • Show the preprocessing that you ran on the dataset and how it affects the model’s accuracy.
    • Describe the metric(s) you’ve used to evaluate the model on the dev set.
    • Describe the hyperparameter search and how each hyperparameter affects the model’s accuracy.  
    
Use the train set to train your model, and the dev set to evaluate it in the experiment phase.  

**When you finish your experiments, print the results on the test set, with the metrics you used in
the experiments phase.**
